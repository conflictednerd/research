# Notes

Writing things down help organize concepts in my mind. Most of the times I prefer writing them on a piece of paper, but sometimes I prefer to type them (mostly when there are pictures involved!). Here are some of the notes I have typed. They include a wide range of subjects and are by no means complete or even correct! Even worse, sometimes before I am done writing, a sudden "aha!" moment happens and things fall in place in my mind. In this case, I am most likely to abandon writing. So apologies in advance for that!
