### Knowledge Representation

### Affordance Detection

_Ability to find reasonable ways to interact with an object_

valid action handicap will result in agents that don't use semantic information in observations.

Instead of that, we can train a model to generate valid actions $f(\mathrm{observation}) \rightarrow \{\mathrm{valid\;actions}\}$.

Such a model will need to have some understanding of objects and how they can be interacted with.

### Commonsense Reasoning

### Language Grounding

_Tie abstract language concepts to physically realizable entities_
